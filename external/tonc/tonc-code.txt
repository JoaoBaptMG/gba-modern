// === Description ===
  Tonc is a tutorial for learning how to program for the GameBoy Advance
(GBA). It covers most aspects of the GBA, often in great detail and 
from an efficiency orientated viewpoint. Among other things, you'll 
see all video modes (0-6), sprites, simple and advanced button 
handling, Rotation/Scaling for backgrounds and sprites (covered the 
_right_ way for a change), mode 7 and programming in ARM assembly.

  Tonc consists of 3 parts: text, code and binaries. Tonc is part of
http://www.coranac.com/ where you can find the on-line text, as
well as zips for the three parts. This readme belongs to the code 
part of the set.

NOTE: this is still a only a beta, though should be close to the
final version.

// === Tonc code (tonc-code.zip) ---
  This contains all the demo projects for tonc as well as the utility
code library tonclib. The code is mainly meant for devkitPro r19 
and higher; for earlier versions or other devkits you'd need to make 
some adjustments.
  The projects fall into 4 categories: basic, extended, advanced and 
lab. The first three are ordered according to difficulty. The basic
projects are fairly simple; they're completely self-contained using 
simple makefiles. The extended projects start to use tonclib and 
contail more advanced (but also more useful) makefiles. The advanced 
projects use tonclib even more, use assembly for data and yet more 
complex makefiles, derived from DKP's templates. The lab demos might 
fall into this category as well, except that they might not be 
completely finished yet. Still worth looking at though.
  Tonclib contains a good number of utility code, taking care of simple
and not so simple items. There's types and a complete memory map +
bit definitions in tonc_memmap.h and tonc_memdef.h. It contains a 
BIOS routines plus some extra, safe and safe memcpy and memset versions 
for words and halfwords and an interrupt system that allows for 
easy to use prioritized and nested interrupts. As this is a bit much 
to take in at once, there's also a doxygen generated manual in 
CHM format.

// === Usage ===
Each project has a Makefile and a .pnproj file for for easy 
compilation. There are also Visual C++ 6 and Express projects for use 
with thise IDEs. You can also run things for a DOS/msys-box like this:

`make tonclib'          To build tonclib.a
`make DEMO=foo'         To build the `foo' demo
`make DEMO=foo clean'   To clean the `foo' demo
`make build_all'        To build all demos
`make clean_all'        To clean all demos

// === Recent changes ===

- 2013-03-24, jv:
  + made ready for DKA r41 (uses arm-none-eabi iso arm-eabi-)
- older
  Too many to list here. Look at log.htm in the text.
